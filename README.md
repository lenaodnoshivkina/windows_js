# windows_js

A classic one-page project in Javascript - the site of a company that manufactures and installs plastic windows.

During the development of the project, the appearance of modal windows was configured when certain triggers were triggered, as well as the work of tabs on the page. In addition, the forms for sending data to the server were configured, and a calculator for calculating the number of calories was implemented. In addition, a module with the display of images was implemented.
